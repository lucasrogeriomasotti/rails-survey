Rails Survey
================
Rails Survey is a simple survey application. You can create surveys, add questions and see the results.

You can test it here: [Rails Surveys Demo on Heroku] (https://rails-survey-demo.herokuapp.com/surveys). Login with _user@example.com_ / _password_ or _admin@example.com_ / _password_

It was created with the help of [Rails Composer] (https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer) and is based on the [Rapidfire gem] (https://github.com/code-mancers/rapidfire), using much of the same logic, just in a way you can customize for your own needs.

Rails Survey started as a project from a research group of [IBGEN] (http://www.ibgen.com.br/), a college with IT courses from Brazil.
