Rails Survey
================
Rails Survey is a simple survey application. You can create surveys, add questions and see the results.

It was created with the help of [Rails Composer] (https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer) and borrow some ideas from the [Rapidfire gem] (https://github.com/code-mancers/rapidfire).

Rails Survey started as a project from a research group of [IBGEN] (http://www.ibgen.com.br/), a college with IT courses from Brazil.
